In computing, a system call is a programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service 
from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. 
A system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system.
A computer program makes a system call when it makes a request to the operating systemâ€™s kernel.
System call provides the services of the operating system to the user programs via Application Program Interface(API). 
It provides an interface between a process and an operating system to allow user-level processes to
request services of the operating system. System calls are the only entry points into the kernel system.
All programs needing resources must use system calls.
